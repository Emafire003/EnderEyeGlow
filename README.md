# EnderEyeGlow
Whenever you throw an Eye of Ender, it will get an outline like the Glowing effect, making it easier to track, in order to not loose it. 

It will also add particles when the item is dropped (Client-mod version only!)
If you install [ColoredGlowLib](https://modrinth.com/mods/coloredglowlib) too, the outline will also have a custom color! (Client-mod version only, for now)

## Flavours
You can install the client mod using the Fabric loader, and you will always see the glow in any server/world you join.

You can add the datapack to your sever/world to make the eye of ender glow for all the clients.

### Planned features:
A config interface for the client mod
Maybe optimize the datapack and and ColoredGlowLib functionality.
